# PolypSense3D: A Multi-Source Benchmark Dataset for Depth-Aware Polyp Size Measurement in Endoscopy

## Introduction

PolypSense3D is the first comprehensive dataset spanning virtual simulations, physical models, and clinical scenarios. It systematically collects and annotates over 43,000 frames of RGB images, dense/sparse depth data, and accurate millimeter-scale polyp measurements, addressing critical gaps in existing datasets for lesion quantification tasks.

## Experiments

The specific details of the experiment will be presented in the paper.
